A very simple lossless audio compressor. Designed to achieve about the same
compression as flac -0 or shorten with the absolute minimum amount of
complexity (in fact, the entire library for both encoding and decoding is a
single C file of less than 500 lines). Being so simple, it's also pretty
quick, even in pure C without multithreading. Possible uses:

1. Learning how lossless audio compressors work.
2. Easily Incorporating lossless audio compression into other apps.
3. Implementing lossless audio compression on limited resource systems, or
   even hardware.

It's important to note that this is NOT a new lossless audio compression
file format! There is a simple command-line front end for demo purposes
that works with WAV files, but the resulting SLAC files are simply a
concatenation of the generated blocks and provide no metadata storage,
no error detection, and no seeking capability. The format COULD be used
inside of another container format like Matroska, but I'm not sure that
would have any value.
